Highly into type-safe Python code?

_runtime_generics_ is a niche Python library that allows you to reuse type arguments explicitly passed at runtime
to generic classes before instantiation.
The library does two things:
- makes it possible to retrieve the type argument passed to the generic class at runtime
  before the class was instantiated;
- given a parametrized generic class (generic alias),
  it makes every class method use generic alias `cls` instead of the origin class.

# Simple example
3.12+ ([PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695) syntax):
```python
from runtime_generics import runtime_generic, select

@runtime_generic
class MyGeneric[T]:
    type_argument: type[T]

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.type_argument = select[T](self)

    @classmethod
    def whoami(cls):
        print(f"I am {cls}")

my_generic = MyGeneric[int]()
assert my_generic.type_argument is int
my_generic.whoami()  # I am MyGeneric[int]

```

3.8+:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from runtime_generics import runtime_generic, select

T = TypeVar("T")

@runtime_generic
class MyGeneric(Generic[T]):
    type_argument: type[T]

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.type_argument = select[T](self)

    @classmethod
    def whoami(cls):
        print(f"I am {cls}")

my_generic = MyGeneric[int]()
assert my_generic.type_argument is int
my_generic.whoami()  # I am MyGeneric[int]
```

    ```shell
    pyenv install 3.8
    ```
1.  Clone your fork locally and install dependencies.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/runtime_generics path/to/runtime_generics
    cd path/to/runtime_generics
    poetry env use $(cat .python-version)
    poetry install
    poetry shell
    pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
    ```
